# METH PHARMA

Meth Pharma is a desktop application made using the gui creation module tkinter of python. It features a home page,
2 pages of medicines and 3 pages of chemical products. With each project page having 6 items, the total number of
products are 30. Every product is accompanied with price, quantity, image and other necessary details. They all have
an add to cart button. The cart stores all the added items and gives a total price with checkout option. The project 
also has a sign in and a log in page. The usernames and passwords inputted in sign in page get stored in a mysql 
database so when a user logs in with the same info, he is able to continue using the app with the same account.
